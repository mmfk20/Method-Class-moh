# Method-Class-moh

This is a simple C# console application that demonstrates:
- Creating a class.
- Defining a `void` method with two integer parameters.
- Performing a math operation on the first integer.
- Displaying the second integer on the screen.
- Instantiating a class in the `Main()` method.
- Calling the method with both **positional parameters** and **named parameters**.
